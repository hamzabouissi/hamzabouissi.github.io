      <description>Introduction with 1-Mistake On that shiny day, I got a project that required deploying a mongodb cluster, After a few searches, I found percona Operator, moved into installation section and copied the helm install command.
After installing the required charts, I noticed that the pods weren&amp;rsquo;t in &amp;ldquo;running&amp;rdquo; state, so as a civilized kubernetes developer I ran &amp;ldquo;kubectl describe pod_name -n namespace&amp;rdquo;, and it turned out the problem was mongodb cluster requires either 3 or 5 nodes</description>

      <description>Introudction Hello, lately I have been trying to deploy a custom Docker image into my local Kubernetes cluster. It turned out I needed to host my Docker image on a container registry, either Docker Hub, which is not suitable for my use case, or deploy and use a local registry. During my research, I found Gitea, which I liked as it allows me to deploy all my projects on it and also host the containers.</description>

      <description>3 days passes, and I&amp;rsquo;m struggling on the same bug, Am I looking at the wrong side of the window, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I think the best way to understand is going back and examine every command line and line of code I wrote.
So at first, After I took the decision to use AWS copilot, I look at the task on JIRA, analyzed it carefully and saw the need to deploy application dependencies first, one of the dependencies is the database .</description>

      <description>You know that feeling ?, when you&amp;rsquo;re escaping a bad documentation, instead crawling around searching for a solution, and you find a snippet of code on Stack Overflow or Reddit, after you copy and paste it, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work then your mind tells you &amp;ldquo;you need to change it a little bit&amp;rdquo;.
So you start changing the code to solve your problem, and guess what? A hell of a lot of new terminology and ideas enter your mind, and you start to get confused.</description>

      <description>Introduction Deploy Previews allow you and your team to experience changes to any part of your site without having to publish them to production.
With a deploy previews feature you and your teammates can see the changes of every pull request you make without merging it, this will reduce the burden of rolling back the environment when bugs happen as you can review the changes before.
In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about creating a CI pipeline with CodeBuild that gets triggered on every pull request creation or update, for every build we host react build folder on an S3 bucket and serve it with Cloudfront, finally after merging the pull request, we delete the build folder from S3.</description>
