      <description>3 days passes, and I&amp;rsquo;m struggling on the same bug, Am I looking at the wrong side of the window, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I think the best way to understand is going back and examine every command line and line of code I wrote.
So at first, After I took the decision to use AWS copilot, I look at the task on JIRA, analyzed it carefully and saw the need to deploy application dependencies first, one of the dependencies is the database .</description>

      <description>You know that feeling ?, when you&amp;rsquo;re escaping a bad documentation, instead crawling around searching for a solution, and you find a snippet of code on Stack Overflow or Reddit, after you copy and paste it, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work then your mind tells you &amp;ldquo;you need to change it a little bit&amp;rdquo;.
So you start changing the code to solve your problem, and guess what? A hell of a lot of new terminology and ideas enter your mind, and you start to get confused.</description>
